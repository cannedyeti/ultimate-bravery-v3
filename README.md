# Ultimate bravery v3

This is v3 of a react based ultimate bravery. I'm sure this will soon evolve into something more.

## Getting started

- To run app, use `npm run dev`

## Component library

Have yet to decide what we're going to use. Options include

- [Material UI](https://mui.com/material-ui/getting-started/)
- [Ant Design](https://ant.design/)
- [Chakra UI](https://v2.chakra-ui.com/getting-started/comparison)
- [ChadCN UI](https://ui.shadcn.com/)
- Other recommendations - will default to noobs

## File structure

[See here](https://github.com/alan2207/bulletproof-react/blob/master/docs/project-structure.md)

## Routing

[TanStack Router](https://tanstack.com/router/latest/docs/framework/react/overview).

Bit of a new technology gaining popularity. Step up from classic react-router

## Caching

[TanStack Query](https://tanstack.com/query/latest/docs/framework/react/overview).

Using query allows us to cache api calls which means we make the calls less often, speeding up the application.
